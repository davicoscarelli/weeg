# Weeg

Welcome to the updated README for Weeg, a pioneering educational platform engineered to close the digital education gap through innovative Mesh Network technology. Given the constraints of a purely hardware-based operation for our official setup, this document aims to guide users through understanding and evaluating The Hive platform and its underlying technology within a controlled software simulation.

## 1. Package Overview

Included in Weeg's submission package, you will find:

- **The Hive Online:** A web application simulating The Hive's educational platform, optimized for a controlled environment on internet to showcase its AI-driven personalized learning experiences.
- **MeshNetwork Firmware:** The source code for our Mesh Network's firmware, showcasing the technology behind our innovative networking solution. Please note that this firmware is intended for hardware applications and is provided for code review and understanding of the Mesh Network's operational principles.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive guides on understanding the operational framework of The Hive, insights into the Mesh Network firmware, and instructions for accessing The Hive's web-app simulation.

## 2. Simulation and Hardware Clarification

To accommodate the evaluation process without physical hardware, we offer a glimpse into The Hive's technology through software simulation and source code review:

- **MeshNetwork Firmware:** While the official operation of The Hive relies and is only compatible on physical hardware, we provide the MeshNetwork firmware's source code for an in-depth look at our system's backbone. This firmware is designed to run on specific hardware configurations and will not operate without the corresponding physical components.
  
- **Hardware-Independent Experience:** Unfortunately, testing the MeshNetwork and experiencing its hardware integration firsthand is not feasible without the actual devices. However, judges and users can review the firmware code to understand the technical intricacies and innovative design of our network.

## 3. The Hive Experience in a Controlled Environment
To provide the experience of The Hive on a traditional internet, we created The Hive Demo, a controlled demo not optimized for Mesh Network connection. 

### Accessing The Hive:

- This simulation aims to provide an insight into the educational content, interactive AI capabilities, and user interface that define The Hive experience.

### Expectations:

- **Controlled Environment Differences:** Hive Online presented is optimized for internet connectivity and includes more complex logic and features than would be available on the actual hardware. This is due to optimization constraints required by the hardware's limited processing capabilities.
  
- **Simplified Solution:** On the actual hardware, The Hive operates through basic HTML files, facilitating accessibility in Mesh Network connectivity. The submitted internet version showcases a more feature-rich experience, designed to demonstrate the platform's potential in traditional internet conditions.

## 4. Technical Considerations and Specifications

- **Technology Insight:** The provided MeshNetwork firmware code, written in C++, offers a detailed view of the operational logic behind our innovative LoRa-based Mesh Network. This insight allows for an appreciation of the technical solutions employed to achieve seamless connectivity in remote educational settings.
  
- **Controlled Experience Specifications:** The Hive Online is designed to mimic Hive's functionality, albeit with optimizations that include internet connectivity and enhanced logic for demonstration purposes.

## 5. Setting Up and Experiencing Hive Demo

## Final Notes

This README and the accompanying software simulation and code documentation are designed to provide a comprehensive overview of The Hive's educational platform and its foundational Mesh Network technology. While we acknowledge the limitations imposed by the absence of physical hardware evaluation, we believe this package offers valuable insights into our commitment to leveraging technology for educational equity.

Thank you for your interest in The Hive. We are dedicated to advancing accessible education globally and look forward to any feedback or inquiries regarding our technology and mission.
